# EMTO
Efficient Multiscale Topology Optimization

This repository will contain all the code needed to reproduce the results presented in submited paper titled "A well connected, locally-oriented and efficient multi-scaletopology optimization strategy (EMTO)"
The code is currently being cleaned and commented and will soon be published here.

The minimum code in order to run EMTO for the MBB case is however already uploaded. In order to launch this case, run mainMulti.m . The evaluation of the design takes a long time. Therefore, line 21 can be commented to have a quick visual result. Without commenting this line, the code runs in 20 minutes on our desktop computer (processor : Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8700 CPU @ 3.20GHz)
