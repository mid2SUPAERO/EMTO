Code to apply a buckling mitigation post-treatment step

To run this code, it is necessary to first retrieve the file database32-32-32.mat from the EMTO general folder. It is also necessary to download the micro-structure database, as explained in the EMTO readme

Once this is done, on can simply type the command 
xPhys=mainMultiAddCross(20,10,0.5,'top88',1,'MBB',500,0.2)
to obtain the results presented in the article.

The design can be saved using the command save('xPhys','xPhys').

writePolynomMiddleLighter.m can then be used to write the dfx file.


The proposed framework uses Method of Moving Asymptotes (MMA) optimization solvers [1]. The associated MMA codes can also be downloaded from http://www.smoptit.se.
The proposed framework also uses the dfxlib by Grzegorz Kwiatek to create dfx files, and lines of code provided by Ferrari (DOI https://doi.org/10.1007/s00158-021-02854-x). 
This code itself used the external function "fsparse" that is part of the "Fast" package by Stefan Engblom. The package can be downloaded here:
